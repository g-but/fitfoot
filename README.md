## 🚨 **AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM - ALWAYS KEEP RUNNING**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This system eliminates manual deployment monitoring forever!**

```bash
./scripts/monitor-status.sh
```

### **🚀 Start Monitoring** (If not running)
```bash
./scripts/start-monitor.sh
```

### **📋 Real-time Logs** (Instead of copying Vercel logs)

tail -f logs/deployment-monitor.log
```

**✅ When Active**: Zero manual intervention needed - system handles everything automatically  
**❌ When Stopped**: You'll need to manually monitor deployments and copy-paste logs again
